#Hackathon Hackers Index
HHIndex is a webapp created in AngularJS that reads the feed from <pre>https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackathonhackers/</pre> and reformats it so it is searchable and more user-friendly for people who want to find older posts.

##Where is it?
The app is live at <pre>https://hhindex.firebaseapp.com</pre> right now!

##Dude, this sucks, what are you doing?
Chill, it's not done yet.
